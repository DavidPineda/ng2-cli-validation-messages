# Angular 2+ Model Driven Forms - Validation Messages
ng2-cli-validation-messages is a migration of [ng2-mdf-validation-messages](https://github.com/d-kostov-dev/ng2-mdf-validation-messages) for @angular/cli

## Notes
* It is [@angular/cli] library workaround, until [angular/angular-cli#1692] will be solved
* It is based on the distributing sources files and supports `aot` build
* It works well as dependency form regular [@angular/cli] project or ejected one
* It has demo app, that could be used as documentation. Use `ng serve -o true` to run it.
* It exposes only `lib` directory.

## Dependencies
No external dependencies except Angular 2 itself.

### Angular 4 Version
This is currently written with version 4.0.0, only by @angular/cli projects
